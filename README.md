# My top 10 video games

Website to display show my favourites games and why they are.

## Requirements

-   The page has a title which informs the user what the site is about

-   The page has a logical layout and clear structure

-   There are images on the page, with alt-text where appropriate

-   The page is visually interesting, for example with borders or colours

-   A list is visible somewhere on the page

-   A user can click on a link that takes them to another website

-   The page has a header element, and a footer element

-   Somewhere on the page, the user can see today’s date. The date should always
    be correct. You’ll need to use JavaScript to generate the date, and DOM
    manipulation to display it.

## Planning

First, I aim to complete freecodecamp responsive design and javascript
algorithms data structures and learn the DOM using the resources tab on the
project page to grasp the fundamentals better.

Since there is a list of requirements, I decided to create a mockup of the
website, which would cover all requirements. This should help save time and
avoid rewriting a large amount of code.
