					My first experience with video games was when I was a young
					kid watching my cousins play ocarina of time on the nintendo
					64. From that day I would go over and play games as much as
					I could. This has become my favourite pasttime till this
					day.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I have played many games over thousands of hours I
					have never created a concrete list of my favourite games as
					there are too many.
				</p>
				<p>
					Disclaimer. I am not a writer or game reviewer. The criteria
					listed below is loose and not very defined as the games
					impact is what I value the most however all of these games
					score high in these areas as they are my top 10.

					<h3 class="game-name">Guild wars 2</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						I have many MMOs ranging from runescape, World of
						warcraft, Elder scrolls online, and Archeage. However
						there is only one MMO I always return to and check in on
						when I have time is GW2. This horizontal progression
						means I do not have to stay commited to the game and
						hunt for better gear everytime an update comes out. I
						still have berserker gear from 2012 near launch which is
						used to this very day.
					</p>
					<p>
						Every class is unique and fun to play. I have all
						classes on my account however my main class is an
						elementalist as it was my first and I enjoy mages.
					</p>
					<p>
						weirdly enough I do not play PVE in this game only PVP
						and WvW. Mainly world v wolrd I have not even completed
						the main story instead spent years doing WvW the combat
						and community have made this game unique and different
						everyday.
					</p>

				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-rank">8. Arena shooter</h2>
					<h3 class="game-name">Halo 3</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My love for Bungie started here. Back then the PS3 was
						not as big for some reason. Everyone had an xbox and
						xbox live. Halo 3 was particularly big. The multiplayer,
						forge, gamemodes, vehicles and maps had enough variety
						that allowed me to play for the entirety of my school
						life.
					</p>
					<p>
						During this time I would also watch the MLG series with
						my friends the first esports I watched.
					</p>

				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-rank">7. First Soulslike</h2>
					<h3 class="game-name">Elden Ring</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My first foray into the souls like genre that wasn't
						sekiro. I would not classify sekiro as a souls like game
						due to its aggresive nature and the parrying mechanic.
						In this game utilising the dodge roll and waiting for an
						oppurtunity sets it apart.
					</p>
					<p>
						While the story is not much the huge amount of lore
						within the game gives it much depth which I found using
						videos online since it requires ingame reading, I only
						watched the cinematics.
					</p>
					<p>
						The strongest parts of this game is the music and
						combat. The amount of playstyles, weapons, spells and
						skills make this game replayable and enjoyable. The main
						bosses each unique encounters with their own music,
						Morgott, Mohg, Godrick, Malenia, Radahn, Rennala,
						Godfrey, Radagon.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-rank">6. Best combat ever</h2>
					<h3 class="game-name">Sekiro</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						For me this is the game with the best combat i have
						played. The parrying system is so satisfying and
						rewarding that no other game has come close to it. The
						strongest parts of this game is the combat and visuals.
						The enviroments where boss battles are set and the
						battles themselves allows this to be put in sixth place.

					<h2 class="game-rank">6. Intro to First person shooters</h2>
					<h3 class="game-name">Call of duty 4 | Call of duty MW2</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						Every day after school I would hop on my XBOX 360 and
						load up either, fifa10, cod4 or halo 3. Call of duty 4
						and MW2 are in this spot due to the amount of fun and
						hours spent laughing and playing with friends. For a
						game which is simply shooting people it held me over for
						3 years. The best aspects of this game are the story,
						and multiplayer.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-rank">5. Intro to Modern RPG</h2>
					<h3 class="game-name">The Witcher 3</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My first CD Projekt Red game. As a person who enjoys as
						much freedom as possible from games this game cemented
						my patronage for this company. Both cyberpunk 2077 and
						the witcher 3 hit my feelings hard and kept me engaged
						with the story and its characters. Also team Yennefer.
					</p>
					<p>
						Feeling & Gameplay- While many were not impressed with
						the combat I love the fluidity and responsiveness of the
						controls and its simplicity. I prefer games which do not
						require use of many skills or items mainly focusing on a
						few strong skills, in this case quen, step dodging and
						light attacks.
					</p>
					<p>
						Story & Characters - Team yen is the only way. The base
						game in addition to its two dlcs hearts of stone, and
						blood and wine give this game incredible value. They
						could be sold as three separte games. The stories and
						characters
					</p>
					<p>
						Music - lelellelle , Cloak and dagger, Steel for humans,
						Silver for monsters, Battle theme, Yennefer theme,
						Geralt of rivia, Toussaint, Street music,
					</p>
					<p>
						Graphics & Setting - The witcher 3, cyberpunk 2077 and
						red dead redemption 2 are the graphic benchmarks for me
						personally.
					</p>
					<p>
						Replayability - The amount of choices make this game
						replayable to see different outcomes.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-rank">4. Best Trilogy</h2>
					<h3 class="game-name">Mass Effect Trilogy</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My second foray into bioware games. For movies Lord of
						the rings is the best trilogy and for video games I
						believe it is the mass effect trilogy. The persistance
						across the games, the choices, gameplay, and story make
						this the best.
					</p>
					<p>
						Feeling & Gameplay- I have always loved first and third
						person shooters so when I found out bioware had a game
						after playing dragon age I quickly went to gamestop and
						purchased these games. As with every RPG my goto is a
						human mage and here the mage are the biotics. Playing as
						a caster and shooter is fun the effects, sound and
						visuals are improved upon each iteration of the game.
						The cover shooting isnt new but its solid.
					</p>
					<p>
						Story & Characters - The strongest point for the game is
						the story, choices and characters. Being a bioware game
						you have many characters whose lives are intertwined
						with the story, eachother and your choices. Once again
						proving their writing skills.
					</p>
					<p>Music - Leaving earth, Suicide mission,</p>
					<p>
						Graphics & Setting - With the release of the anniversary
						edition it is has become more playable however even the
						old versions hold up well. Setting in a futuristic world
						where large distance travel is normal.
					</p>
					<p>
						Replayability - The amount of choices classes and
						different companions makes this game incredibly
						replayable.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-rank">3. Modding Heaven</h2>
					<h3 class="game-name">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My second elder scrolls game after oblivion. While I was
						debating putting oblivion here I chose skyrim as I have
						more hours as I have continously returned to skyrim
						through modding.
					</p>
					<p>
						My first choice for RPGs is always a human mage. In this
						game the magic schools allowed me to roleplay as a magic
						wielding many forms of magic. Through modding the game
						became immersive and replayable. For vanilla skyrim I
						have around 400 hours and with modding I have around
						3000 hours. Every couple of months I will return to this
						game install new modpacks and play through the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						Enderal the only full scale mod I loved. This mod
						deserves its on position as it set the bar for mods and
						it is one of a kind currently.
					</p>
					<p>
						Feeling & Gameplay - Using two hands for magic is one of
						skyrims unique mechanics as there arent many first
						person magic games. This allowed me to be any type of
						mage I wanted to be. I enjoyed playing as an archer and
						sword and board. The amount of rereleases show the fun
						factor of the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						Story & Characters - Nothing too revolutionary here as
						you are a weak person at the begining getting more
						powerful to defeat the big bad at the end. There is more
						lore throughout the world if explored.
					</p>
					<p>
						Music - When the skyrim trailer launched it became
						instantly iconic. Everyone knows when the chants start
						what theme is being played.
					</p>
					<p>
						Graphics & Setting - The graphics were good for a game
						released in its time. It has been rereleased so many
						times and hasn't changed much.
					</p>
					<p>
						Replayability - The world is so big with so many quests
						it requires multiple play throughs. There are different
						ways of playing such as stealth, magic, melee and more.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-rank">2. RPG measuring bar</h2>
					<h3 class="game-name">Dragon age: Origins</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My first bioware game and introduction to choices and
						consequences in gaming. My first game with romancable
						characters and companions with personalities.
					</p>
					<p>
						This game set the bar very high for future RPGs. I will
						always remember the party I used for this game,
						Alistair, Leliana, Morrigan and my grey warden. The
						choices and interactions with companions are incredible
						before this I had only played linear games. The freedom
						to choose different paths for the story has made me a
						bioware fan.
					</p>
					<p>
						Feeling & Gameplay- FOR FERELDEN AND FOR THE GREY
						WARDENNSSSSSSS - Alistair. Ive never liked tactical
						gameplay in dragon age and Ive played every one. The
						game is so good in other areas it doesnt bother me as
						much. However with the annoucement to move away from
						tactical for dragon age 4 I am excited.
					</p>
					<p>
						Story & Characters - Oh Morrigan my first video game
						love. From witch of the wilds who only cared about
						herself to a loving wife and mother. Leliana a
						bard(assassin) escaping her path and finding a new life
						in the chantry. Alistair a grey warden and reluctant
						king. There are too many loved characters but biowares
						strength writing characters is incredible.
					</p>
					<p>
						Music - Chantries hubris and main theme. While the music
						wasnt too stand out consisting of orchestral themes the
						main theme which plays throughout the game and the
						chantries hubris during the final mission is incredible
						memorable.
					</p>
					<p>
						Graphics & Setting - The graphics were incredible back
						then and still hold up today with good looking models
						and enviroments.
					</p>
					<p>
						Replayability - The amount of choices, races, classes
						and different companions makes this game incredibly
						replayable. I only play human in RPGs but for people who
						don't mind playing other races it adds extra
						replayability.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-rank">1. The GOAT</h2>
					<h3 class="game-name">Read Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2)</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						The GOAT. Currently the greatest game of all time in my
						opinion. Every aspect is perfect, feeling, graphics,
						music, story, characters, fun and replayability.
					</p>
					<p>
						I will always remember Arthur Morgan and his journey. He
						is the greatest video game protagonist.
					</p>
					<p>
						Feeling & Gameplay - When playing this game I am
						incredibly immersed and feel like the protagonist arthur
						morgan. Everytime I think about this game I think about
						the story and how much I love the characters. The single
						action mechanic is incredible especially using an xbox
						controller with the trigger buttons, it feels like im
						more invovled with the gun.
					</p>
					<p>
						Story & Characters - From thug to thug with a heart of
						gold depending on how you play. But one thing is always
						true arthur cares about his family Characters. A game
						were you care about every character in the main camp is
						incredible I spent so much time at camp listening and
						talking to the gang members
					</p>
					<p>
						Music - American venom, You're my brother, Unshaken,
						Thats the way it is, See the fire in your eyes, .
						Everytime I hear these soundtracks all the feelings,
						goosebumps come flowing back. Incredible music tied with
						memorable moments and cinematic visuals.
					</p>
					<p>
						Graphics & Setting - On my old rig which has a 5700xt
						this game looks incredible. The characters are all
						detailed the world is crisp and sharp.
					</p>
					<p>
						Replayability - The world is so big and detailed it is
						well positioned for multiple play throughs and atleast
						two if wanting to see experience between low and high
						honor arthur.
