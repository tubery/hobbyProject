						My first experience with video games was when I was a
						kid watching my cousins play the legend of zelda ocarina
						of time on the Nintendo 64. From that day, I would go
						over and play games as much as possible. Playing video
						games has become my favourite pastime to this day.
					</p>
					<p>
						While I have played many games over thousands of hours,
						I have never created a concrete list of my favourite
						games, as there are too many. As I am not a writer or
						game reviewer, these ratings will be mostly based on how
						they impacted me.
					</p>
					<p>
						These are the games off the top of my head. I'm sure
						there are far more games or games I haven't played which
						deserve a spot; however, I am limited by time and
						platform availability. The main areas that stand out to
						me when I play games are listed below.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Feeling & Gameplay</span> - How
							it feels to control the character, and how much fun
							the gameplay loop is.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Story & Characters</span> - How
							much the story affects me and how engaging the
							characters are.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Music</span> - When I listen to
							game soundtracks, can I recall the game, the scenes,
							and the feelings?
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Graphics & Setting</span> - This
							is the game world and how it is presented.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Replayability</span> - How many
							times can I play the game.

					<h3 class="game-award">Looter Shooter King</h3>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My favourite looter shooter. Sometimes games are too
						complex, depending on my state of mind. So when I want
						casual fun where my time is rewarded, I boot up looter
						games like Diablo 3, or when I want to shoot things,
						Destiny 2.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						This game has shooting mechanics that are like no other.
						The pace, recoil, sound, bullet magnet, reload, and
						animations make you feel like a hero without being too
						overpowered.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						The music, story and new content keep this game fresh
						with new equipment to chase after. Unfortunately, it is
						not higher because my current life is busy; I have yet
						to be able to play the latest updates.

					<h3 class="game-award">Best MMORPG</h3>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						The stand-out feature of this game for me is the WvWvW
						or WvW (WorldvsWorldvsWorld). When I bought this game in
						2012, I did not complete the story quest; instead went
						into WvW. From there, I spent around 95% of my time in
						this game mode when playing this game.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						There are a few games with this feature. I can only
						think of ESO (The Elder scrolls online). The large-scale
						three-way battles involving different servers are unique
						and so much fun. The combat and community make this
						unique, as each server has its own identity, people and
						ways to play. The combat is hybrid action and tab
						targetting at a fast pace.

					<h3 class="game-award">Favourite Soulslike</h3>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My first foray into the souls-like genre that wasn't
						sekiro. I would not classify sekiro as a soul-like game
						due to its aggressive nature and parrying mechanic. In
						this game, utilising the dodge roll and waiting for an
						opportunity sets it apart.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						The strongest parts of this game are the music and
						combat. The number of playstyles, weapons, spells and
						skills make this game replayable and enjoyable. It is
						addicting to learn how to overcome a challenging
						encounter.

					</h2>
					<h3 class="game-award">Best combat</h3>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						This is the game with the best combat I have played. The
						parrying system is so satisfying and rewarding that no
						other game has come close to it. However, the most
						substantial parts of this game are the combat and
						visuals. The environments where boss battles are set and
						the fights themselves allow this to be put in sixth
						place.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						This game is in the high spot because it is a
						one-of-a-kind game where I wish other games would copy
						the combat. Another honourable mention is dragons dogma
						which deserves praise for its combat.

					<h3 class="game-award">Favourite First person shooters</h3>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						Every day after school, I would hop on my XBOX 360 and
						load up either fifa10, cod4 or halo 3. Call of duty 4,
						MW2 and halo 3 are in this spot due to the fun and hours
						spent laughing and playing with friends. But, for a game
						about simply shooting people, it held me over for three
						years.

					<h3 class="game-award">Favourite Modern RPG</h3>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My first CD Projekt Red game. As a person who enjoys as
						much freedom as possible from games, this game cemented
						my patronage of this company. Both cyberpunk 2077 and
						the witcher 3 hit my feelings hard and kept me engaged
						with the story and its characters.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						While many were not impressed with the combat, I love
						the fluidity and responsiveness of the controls, and
						it's simplicity. I prefer games that do not require many
						skills or items, mainly focusing on a few vital skills,
						such as quen, step dodging and light attacks.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						The base game, in addition to its two dlcs hearts of
						stone, blood, and wine, gives this game incredible
						value. The stories make me invested in these characters
						wanting the best for each of them by trying to get the
						best ending. Also I am on team Yennefer.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						Cloak and dagger, Steel for humans, Silver for monsters,
						Battle theme, Yennefer theme, Geralt of rivia,
						Toussaint, Street music, etc. I could go on and on about
						the soundtracks, but there are too many. The soundtrack
						perfectly suits this world and every situation they are
						used in.

					<h3 class="game-award">Best Trilogy</h3>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My second foray into BioWare games. For movies, Lord of
						the rings is the best trilogy, and for video games, I
						believe it is the mass effect trilogy. The persistence
						across the games, the choices, the gameplay, and the
						story make this the best.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						The best areas of the game are the story, choices and
						characters. Being a BioWare game, you have many
						characters whose lives are intertwined with the story,
						each other and your choices.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						While the combat is nothing special, the twist BioWare
						adds is the skills which have improved upon each
						iteration of the trilogy.

					<h3 class="game-award">Modding Heaven</h3>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My second elder scrolls game after oblivion. While
						debating putting oblivion here, I chose Skyrim as I have
						more hours and have continuously returned to Skyrim
						through modding.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My first choice for RPGs is always a male human mage. In
						this game, the magic schools allowed me to roleplay as a
						mage wielding many forms of magic. Modding the game adds
						immersion and replayability. I have around 400 hours for
						vanilla Skyrim, and with modding, I have about 3000
						hours. Every few months, I will return to this game,
						install new mod packs and play through the game.

						Enderal is the full-scale mod. This mod could be in its

					<h3 class="game-award">RPG measuring bar</h3>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My first BioWare game and introduction to choices and
						consequences in gaming. My first game with romanceable
						characters and companions with personalities.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						This game set the bar very high for future RPGs. I will
						always remember the party I used for this game,
						Alistair, Leliana, Morrigan and my grey warden. The
						choices and interactions with companions are incredible.
						Before this, I had only played linear games. The freedom
						to choose different paths for the story has made me a
						BioWare fan.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						I've always disliked tactical gameplay in dragon age,
						and I've played every instalment. The game is so good in
						other areas it doesn't bother me as much. However, I am
						excited about the announcement to move away from
						tactical for dragon age 4.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						Morrigan is my first video game love from a witch of the
						wilds who only cared about herself to a loving wife and
						mother. Leliana, a bard(assassin), escaping her past and
						finds a new life in the chantry(religion). Alistair the
						funny grey warden and a reluctant king. There are too
						many loved characters, but BioWare's strength in writing
						characters is incredible.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						The amount of choices, races, classes and different
						companions makes this game incredibly replayable. I only
						play humans in RPGs, but it adds extra replayability for
						people who don't mind playing other races.

					<h3 class="game-award">The GOAT</h3>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						Currently the greatest game of all time. Every aspect is
						perfect, feeling, graphics, visuals, music, story,
						characters, fun and replayability. I will always
						remember Arthur Morgan and his journey. He is the
						greatest video game protagonist.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						I am incredibly immersed in this game and feel like the
						protagonist Arthur Morgan. Whenever I think about this
						game, I think about the story and how much I love the
						characters. The single-action mechanic is incredible,
						especially using an Xbox controller with trigger
						buttons. I'm more involved with the gun by having
						control of the hammer and trigger.
					</p>
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						From outlaw to an outlaw with a heart of gold, depending
						on how you play. But one thing is always true Arthur
						cares about his gang members. A game where you care
						about every character is incredible. I spent so much
						time at camp listening and talking to the gang members.
