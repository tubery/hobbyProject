					My first experience with video games was when I was a kid
					watching my cousins play ocarina of time on the nintendo 64.
					From that day I would go over and play games as much as I
					could. This has become my favourite pasttime till this day.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I have played many games over thousands of hours I
					have never created a concrete list of my favourite games as
					there are too many. As I am not a writer or game reviewer
					these ratings will be mostly based on how they impacted me.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I am playing games the main areas that stand out to me
					are listed below.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Feeling & Gameplay - How it feels to control the
						character and how much fun the gameplay loop is.
					</li>
					<li>
						Story & Characters - How much the story affects me and
						how interesting the characters are.
					</li>
					<li>
						Music - When I listen to game soundtracks am I able to
						recall the game ,the scenes, and the feelings
					</li>
					<li>
						Graphics & Setting - This is the game world and how its
						presented.
					</li>
					<li>
						Replayability - How many times can I play the game
						without getting bored.
					</li>
				</ul>

					<h2 class="game-name">10. Destiny 2</h2>
					<h3 class="game-award">Looter Shooter King</h3>

					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My favourite looter shooter. Sometimes games are too
						complex depending on my state of mind. When I want
						casual fun where my time is rewarded I boot up looter
						games like Diablo 3 or when I want to shoot things
						Destiny 2. This game has shooting mechanics that are
						like no other. I am a hand cannon fanatic I hunt for the
						best feeling ones and keep many in my inventory.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-name">9. Guild wars 2</h2>
					<h3 class="game-award">Best MMORPG</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						The stand out feature for this game for me is the WvWvW
						or WvW (WorldvsWorldvsWorld). When I bought this game in
						2012 I did not complete the story quest instead went
						into WvW. From there I spent around 95% of my time in
						this game mode when playing this game.
					</p>
					<p>
						There aren't many games that have this feature the only
						one I can think of is ESO (The Elder scrolls online).
						The threeway large scale battles involving different
						servers is unique and so much fun. The combat and
						community make this truly unique as each server has its
						own identity, people and ways to play.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-name">8. Elden Ring</h2>
					<h3 class="game-award">Favourite Soulslike</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My first foray into the souls like genre that wasn't
						sekiro. I would not classify sekiro as a souls like game
						due to its aggresive nature and the parrying mechanic.
						In this game utilising the dodge roll and waiting for an
						oppurtunity sets it apart.
					</p>
					<p>
						The strongest parts of this game is the music and
						combat. The amount of playstyles, weapons, spells and
						skills make this game replayable and enjoyable. The main
						bosses each unique encounters with their own music,
						Morgott, Mohg, Godrick, Malenia, Radahn, Rennala,
						Godfrey, Radagon. It is addicting learning how to
						overcome a challegning encounter.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-name">7. Sekiro</h2>
					<h3 class="game-award">Best combat ever</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						For me this is the game with the best combat i have
						played. The parrying system is so satisfying and
						rewarding that no other game has come close to it. The
						strongest parts of this game is the combat and visuals.
						The enviroments where boss battles are set and the
						battles themselves allows this to be put in sixth place.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h3 class="game-name">
						6. Call of duty 4 | Call of duty MW2 | Halo 3
					</h3>
					<h3 class="game-award">Favourite First person shooters</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						Every day after school I would hop on my XBOX 360 and
						load up either, fifa10, cod4 or halo 3. Call of duty 4
						,MW2 and halo 3 are in this spot due to the amount of
						fun and hours spent laughing and playing with friends.
						For a game which is simply shooting people it held me
						over for 3 years.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-name">5. The Witcher 3</h2>
					<h3 class="game-award">Favourite Modern RPG</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My first CD Projekt Red game. As a person who enjoys as
						much freedom as possible from games this game cemented
						my patronage for this company. Both cyberpunk 2077 and
						the witcher 3 hit my feelings hard and kept me engaged
						with the story and its characters. Also team Yennefer.
					</p>
					<p>
						While many were not impressed with the combat I love the
						fluidity and responsiveness of the controls and its
						simplicity. I prefer games which do not require use of
						many skills or items mainly focusing on a few strong
						skills, in this case quen, step dodging and light
						attacks.
					</p>
					<p>
						Team yen is the only way. The base game in addition to
						its two dlcs hearts of stone, and blood and wine give
						this game incredible value. They could be sold as three
						separte games. The stories makes me invested in these
						characters wanting the best for each of them and trying
						to get the best ending.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cloak and dagger, Steel for humans, Silver for monsters,
						Battle theme, Yennefer theme, Geralt of rivia,
						Toussaint, Street music, etc... I could go on and on
						about the soundtracks but there are too many. The
						soundtrack is perfectly suited for this world and every
						situation they are used in.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-name">4. Mass Effect Trilogy</h2>
					<h3 class="game-award">Best Trilogy</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My second foray into bioware games. For movies Lord of
						the rings is the best trilogy and for video games I
						believe it is the mass effect trilogy. The persistance
						across the games, the choices, gameplay, and story make
						this the best.
					</p>
					<p>
						The strongest point for the game is the story, choices
						and characters. Being a bioware game you have many
						characters whose lives are intertwined with the story,
						eachother and your choices. Once again proving their
						writing skills.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-name">3. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h2>
					<h3 class="game-award">Modding Heaven</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My second elder scrolls game after oblivion. While I was
						debating putting oblivion here I chose skyrim as I have
						more hours as I have continously returned to skyrim
						through modding.
					</p>
					<p>
						My first choice for RPGs is always a human mage. In this
						game the magic schools allowed me to roleplay as a mage
						wielding many forms of magic. Through modding the game
						it adds immersion and replayability. For vanilla skyrim
						I have around 400 hours and with modding I have around
						3000 hours. Every couple of months I will return to this
						game install new modpacks and play through the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						Enderal the only full scale mod I loved. This mod
						deserves its on position as it set the bar for mods and
						it is one of a kind currently.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-name">2. Dragon age: Origins</h2>
					<h3 class="game-award">RPG measuring bar</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						My first bioware game and introduction to choices and
						consequences in gaming. My first game with romancable
						characters and companions with personalities.
					</p>
					<p>
						This game set the bar very high for future RPGs. I will
						always remember the party I used for this game,
						Alistair, Leliana, Morrigan and my grey warden. The
						choices and interactions with companions are incredible
						before this I had only played linear games. The freedom
						to choose different paths for the story has made me a
						bioware fan.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ive never liked tactical gameplay in dragon age and Ive
						played every one. The game is so good in other areas it
						doesnt bother me as much. However with the annoucement
						to move away from tactical for dragon age 4 I am
						excited.
					</p>
					<p>
						Morrigan my first video game love. From witch of the
						wilds who only cared about herself to a loving wife and
						mother. Leliana a bard(assassin) escaping her path and
						finding a new life in the chantry. Alistair a grey
						warden and reluctant king. There are too many loved
						characters but biowares strength writing characters is
						incredible.
					</p>
					<p>
						The amount of choices, races, classes and different
						companions makes this game incredibly replayable. I only
						play human in RPGs but for people who don't mind playing
						other races it adds extra replayability.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="game-card">
					<h2 class="game-name">1. Read Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2)</h2>
					<h3 class="game-award">The GOAT</h3>
					<img src="" alt="" class="game-cover" />
					<p class="game-rank-reason">
						The GOAT. Currently the greatest game of all time in my
						opinion. Every aspect is perfect, feeling, graphics,
						music, story, characters, fun and replayability. I will
						always remember Arthur Morgan and his journey. He is the
						greatest video game protagonist.
					</p>
					<p>
						When playing this game I am incredibly immersed and feel
						like the protagonist arthur morgan. Everytime I think
						about this game I think about the story and how much I
						love the characters. The single action mechanic is
						incredible especially using an xbox controller with the
						trigger buttons, it feels like im more invovled with the
						gun.
					</p>
					<p>
						From thief to a thief with a heart of gold depending on
						how you play. But one thing is always true arthur cares
						about his family Characters. A game were you care about
						every character in the main camp is incredible I spent
						so much time at camp listening and talking to the gang
						members
					</p>
					<p>
						American venom, You're my brother, Unshaken, Thats the
						way it is, See the fire in your eyes, . Everytime I hear
						these soundtracks all the feelings, goosebumps come
						flowing back. Incredible music tied with memorable
						moments and cinematic visuals.
					</p>
					<p>
						The world is so big and detailed it is well positioned
						for multiple play throughs and atleast two if wanting to
						see experience between low and high honor arthur.
					</p>

				<p>
					These are the games of the top of my head Im sure there are
					far more games or games I havent played which deserve a spot
					however I am limited by time and platform availability.
					Thank you for reading.
